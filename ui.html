                <h2>LEG Of Record</h2>
                <p>I am involved in a fantasy football league that is taken way too serious, and we love it. I built this "LEG of Record" web application that allows us to keep track of who the best really is. In doing so I became extremely underwhelmed with my stats, but it was a lot of fun to build. <a href="http://www.legofrecord.com" target="_blank" class="moreLink">View Design</a> </p>

                <h2>Celebration Church</h2>
                <p>My church, Celebration, is opening a new facility in Georgetown, TX and to go with the new state of the art sanctuary we decided to completly re-design the website. The main goal of the re-design was to focus attention on our church's dedication to connecting people to their God given destiny. Whether through serving, small-groups, or just getting connected in the church we wanted members to have a direct line to getting involved in the church community. <a href="http://celebration.church" target="_blank" class="moreLink">View Design</a> </p>

                <p>Travis Zippe is a photographer in Southern California, as well as my cousin, and I created a brand identity for him that included a logo design and website. While we have yet to launch this site, the goal is to allow people to purchase some of the shots Travis has taken through the website as well as connect and book him for events. <a href="http://clients.zippetomylou.com/tzp" target="_blank" class="moreLink">View Design</a></p>

                <p>The founder of Best Pickup Toolbox came to me with a prototype that he was wanting to get word out about. The design and build out was simple but provided to be a great tool that allowed him to share specs on his invention with several people in the space. <a href="http://www.bestpickuptoolbox.com" target="_blank" class="moreLink">View Design</a> </p>

                <h2>AppQuil</h2>
                <p>As a startup venture focused on web security and data protection AppQuil needed an intuitive web presence that quickly communicated a sense of trust. To convey this trust we took a clean and modern approach to match AppQuil’s industry leading penetration and ethical hacking services. Zippetomylou Designs worked hand-in-hand with AppQuil to build an identity and strategy that would allow them to break into the web security industry. <a href="http://clients.zippetomylou.com/appquil" target="_blank" class="moreLink">View Design</a> </p>

                <h2>AveNew</h2>
                <p>AveNew came to Zippetomylou Designs in 2014 looking to build their web presence as an Austin, Texas young adults group. AveNew needed a website that could be used at their parent church, Riverbend, to promote the group as well as a place to share information on upcoming events. To solve this issue we included a google calendar api that duplicated AveNew’s events for all to see on the website. Along with the google calendar api, the website also features a simple form allowing for new or current members to inquire information on upcoming events and/or the group. <a href="http://www.avenewatriverbend.com" target="_blank" class="moreLink">View Design</a> </p>

                <p>TotalSource came about in 2015 as a sister company to HomeSource, offering state of the art bottle-less drinking options to business’. As one of the leaders in providing filtered water options, TotalSource was looking for a clean and sophisticated design that fit their product and catered to their national stage. Zippetomylou Designs fitted TotalSource with a fully responsive website providing their clients with all the information needed to choose a water cooler best suited for them. <a href="http://www.homesourcecoolers.com" target="_blank" class="moreLink">View Design</a> </p>

                <p>Elder Benefit offers a free source for families to find elder care needs for the loved ones. They came to Zippetomylou Designs in 2014 looking to redesign their website to a more updated and professional look. Though Elder Benefit had a site structure in place, we choose to re-write the site from scratch in order to update and modernize the mark up to fit html5 standards. The responsive design fit Elder Benefit’s needs so well they used the template to update a number of sister sites associated with them as well. <a href="http://www.elderbenefit.com" target="_blank" class="moreLink">View Design</a> </p>

                <p>B & M Take Chicago was a personal side project Zippetomylou Designs took on in 2014. The website was an experimental project of sorts aiming to capture memories from a recent trip to Chicago, Illinois. The site featured a blown out full stack design focused on images from the trip that were displayed in a slide-like manner using scroll effects via javascript. The site fulfilled its purpose of capturing and storing a vacation on the web and has sense turned into one of Zippetomylou Designs featured products <a href="http://testing.zippetomylou.com/bnmtakechicago/" target="_blank" class="moreLink">View Design</a> </p>

                <p>The Afib Experience is a community that I built while with Personify. The sites main purpose was to serve as a hub for patients and doctors alike to get in touch with one another. I lead the entire project from design to development working with members from the Afib non-profit organization.</p>

                <p>After completing the AGLN project, the members of their youth program reached out for a similar community. While they were essentially the same concept, AYLF wanted the site to be much more sleek and modern to apeal to the 14 to 24 year old audience they desired. I again was the lead designer and developer while working with members of the AYLF design team.</p>

                <p>Another community I designed and built while at Personify was NACGP. They had already established a brand guide and color palette so the main design objective here was to make the community flow seamlessly with their current website. I was the only developer during this project and worked with NACGP's exsisting design team to get mockups approved and developed.</p>
